    "A seismic station (or seismograph) consists of a sensor (seismometer),\n",
    "an analog to digital converter (digitizer) and the recorder. The\n",
    "seismometer converts the ground motion (input) into another continuous\n",
    "physical signal, like a voltage (or the motion of the stylos drawing on\n",
    "a sheet of paper). The digitizer converts the output signal from the\n",
    "sensor into a number called *count*, just like we do with a digital voltmeter.\n",
    "The digitizer is characterized by the resolution (how we discretize the\n",
    "continuous amplitude of the voltage into *counts*) and the sampling rate\n",
    "(how many *counts* per second). In the end, the recorder stores the\n",
    "*counts* from the ditigitizer into flash memories or hard disks.\n",

    "Sensors are divided into passive and active sensors. A (modern) passive\n",
    "seismometer mainly consists of a spring-mass system and a coil embedded\n",
    "into a magnetic field that both damps the motion of the mass with\n",
    "respect to the seismometer and outputs a voltage which is nearly\n",
    "proportional to the ground velocity above the natural frequency of the\n",
    "spring-mass system (typically of the order of 1 Hz, although it\n",
    "can be as low as 0.03 Hz). It thus can be seen as a velocity\n",
    "transducer. Older passive seismometers, instead, simply consist of a\n",
    "spring-mass system in series with a dash pot (usually filled with oil)\n",
    "and measure the displacement of the mass through a stylus drawing on a\n",
    "sheet of paper or some other optical devices. An active seismometer, like the\n",
    "force balanced accelerometers (FBA), adds a displacement transducer\n",
    "(i.e., a capacitor whose capacitance varies with the displacement of the\n",
    "mass) that sends, in a negative feedback loop, a current to the coil\n",
    "which exerts a force equal and opposite to the inertia force in order to\n",
    "prevent the mass from moving at all with respect to the seismometer.\n",
    "This current, being proportional to the ground acceleration in a large\n",
    "frequency band, gives a direct measure of it.\n",

    "Passive seismometers, although less accurate than the active ones, are\n",
